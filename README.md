[![Heroku](https://heroku-badge.herokuapp.com/?app=my-reads-bruno)]

This is the first graduation project for the [React Nanodegree Program](https://br.udacity.com/course/react-nanodegree--nd019) from Udacity. 

My reads is a project to manage the reading of books between three types, being: want read, read and read. 

I opted to develop the project to create my layout from scratch and not use the layout provided by udacity.
